            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p class="text">
                We are a group of five (5) student at Sorbonne University doing master degree on Mechatronics System for Rehabilation. For the final project of Designing Mechatronics Systems, our teacher Mr.Verite gives us the challenge to do the MyoCoach project in
                collaboration with ORTHOPUS. The MyoCoach is a device intended for people with limb amputations who wish to wear a myoelectric prosthesis composed of 2EMG electrodes. It allows you to practice the contraction of the muscles of the forearm
                thanks to a video game inspired by Flappy Bird, and to train the control of the future prosthesis. The MyoCoach can also be used by healthcare professionals and more particularly to ortho-prosthetists and occupational therapists, as it
                allows to place the myoelectric sensors correctly and adjust them for a correct optimal use of myoelectric prostheses.
